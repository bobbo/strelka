This directory is populated by generated code using krpc-mars-terraformer & edited slightly. 

If you are building your own version of the program against a different set of KRPC service definitions, you'll have to
re-generate this code and fiddle with it until the compiler errors stop.

As I'm already having to maintain a branch of krpc-mars-terraformer, I might just bring it in tree and make it work better.
